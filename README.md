# Fire-extinguisher-manual

## What is that and what is its value
- A project that solves a real problem: quick and intuitive fire extinguisher instructions in virtual reality for people who are in a stressful situation and do not have the appropriate training.
- Private project developed independently by me.

## Demo

## Technologies
- Unity 3D
- C#
- Github Actions

## Why is this valuable to the employer
- Designing the entire flow from scratch.
- Own design decisions and compromises.

## Roadmap
This project is developed in clearly defined stages, focusing on building a strong VR foundation first, followed by immersive features and finally production-ready architecture.
